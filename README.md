# Javascript and React Blog

This is a personal blog to publish javascript advance topics .

## I built it from scratch ✌🏻Just to learn how think actually work .

# drawbacks :

- Biggest one it that how to Convert regular text to markdown language then convert it to html 😭 and i solved it. 👍🏻
- Build UI cards that should be a absolute position, it was really hard task.
- file structers .
- Application state management 😡 as you know it's a hardest stage in development phase. Solve it with Context API 😌
- save post in local storage and retreive it from it .
- how to move articles that marked as a bookmarked post to bookmark component .

# Finally, I learned a lot of stuff about react and state management system, I profoundly thanks my self.
